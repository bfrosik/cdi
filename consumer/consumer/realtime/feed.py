Please make sure the installation :ref:`pre-requisite-reference-label` are met.

This module feeds the data coming from detector to a process using queue. It interracts with a channel access
plug in of area detector. The read of frame data from channel access happens on event of frame counter change.
The change is detected with a callback. The data type is determined from PV. The data and the type are passed
(as object) to the consuming process.
This module requires configuration file with the following parameters:
'detector', a string defining the first prefix in area detector, it has to match the area detector configuration
'detector_basic', a string defining the second prefix in area detector, defining the basic parameters, it has to
match the area detector configuration
'detector_image', a string defining the second prefix in area detector, defining the image parameters, it has to
match the area detector configuration
'no_frames', number of frames that will be fed. If not given, the optional parameter 'sequence' to the feed_data
method must not be None. It can be either int defining number of frames, or a list of touples, defining data types
sequence. (i.e. [('data_dark', 4), ('data_white', 14), ('data', 614), ('data_dark', 619))
'args', optional, list of process specific parameters, they need to be parsed to the desired format in the wrapper

        This function receives data, processes it, and delivers to consuming process.

        This function is invoked at the beginning of the feed as a distinct thread. It reads data from a thread_dataq

        If the counter is not a consecutive number to the previous reading a 'missing' string is enqueued into
        process_dataq in place of the data to mark the missing frames.
        For every received frame data, it reads a data type from PV, and the two elements are delivered to a consuming
        process via process_dataq as Data instance. If a sequence is defined, then the data type for this frame
        determined from sequence is compared with the data type read from PV. If they are different, a warning log is
        recorded.
        On the loop exit an 'all_data' string is enqueud into the inter-process queue, and 'exit' string is enqueued
        into the inter-thread queue, to notify the main thread of the exit event.
